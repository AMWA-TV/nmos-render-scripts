%AMWA_ID% has been developed by the [Advanced Media Workflow Association](https://www.amwa.tv) as part of the [Networked Media Open Specifications](https://www.nmos.tv) initiative.
See [here](https://specs.amwa.tv/nmos) for an overview of NMOS specifications.

The [NMOS Testing Tool](https://specs.amwa.tv/nmos-testing) creates a simple web service for testing implementations of all NMOS APIs.

The links to documentation, API and examples below, and for SPEC links in the page menu bar are for this release or branch: **%DEFAULT_TREE%**. Links to [other published releases](releases/) and [other live branches](branches/) appear later in the page, or in the VERSIONS menu.
