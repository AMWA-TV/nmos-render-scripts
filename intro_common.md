%AMWA_ID% has been developed by the [Advanced Media Workflow Association](https://www.amwa.tv) as part of the [Networked Media Open Specifications](https://www.nmos.tv) initiative.

See [here](https://specs.amwa.tv/nmos) for an overview of NMOS specifications.

The formal specification is provided in [this GitHub repository](%REPO_ADDRESS%). These pages provide supporting documentation and HTML renders of the APIs (which are specified in RAML and JSON Schema).

The links to documentation, API and examples below and for DOCS and SPEC in the page menu bar are for this release or branch: **%DEFAULT_TREE%**. Links to [other releases](releases/) and [other branches](branches/) appear later in the page, or in the VERSIONS menu.
